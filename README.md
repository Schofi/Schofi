- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Schofi
- ðŸ”­ I'm passionate about large language models and AI system development
- ðŸŒ± Currently diving deep into:
  - Distributed training frameworks (Megatron-LM, DeepSpeed)
  - Model optimization techniques (quantization, pruning)
  - GPU acceleration and CUDA optimization
- ðŸ’» Tech stack:
  - Languages: Python (PyTorch), C++ (high-performance computing), Go (backend systems)
  - Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Docker, NVIDIA GPU Stack
  - Special interest in Linux systems and filesystem optimization for AI workloads
- âœ¨ Interested in:
  - Collaborative open-source LLM projects
  - Novel model architectures
  - Efficient inference techniques

ðŸš€ Currently exploring the intersection of systems programming and large-scale ML!
